This extension was written and published by Adrian Lungu. It was on Github at some point.

It was removed from Chrome Web Store at some point. :(

I (paulirish) recovered it and put it on Github. Because I like it.



### To install

Install as an unpacked extension. To do that:

* Download this repo or clone it
* Open chrome://extensions
* Enable "Developer mode" at the top of the page
* Click "Load unpacked" and find the folder of your checkout (where `manifest.json` is). Select it.
* Ta-da! It's installed.

Once the window is open, click the hamburger menu for a few preferences. There's also a bunch of options under "More options".
